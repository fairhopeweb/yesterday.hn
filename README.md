Read yesterday's Hacker News with today's comments. https://yesterday.hn.

## Why?

When I do my morning [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) routine, I often find interesting stories on the `new` page, but for the ones that were posted recently (with too few comments), I find myself deferring reading the story as I want to read its associated comments in one go.

When I come back the next morning, that particular story has already disappeared (into page 2).

So I created this simple redirection to read yesterday's Hacker News with the most recent comments.
